# Thesis

This is my Thesis. The problem was to find a way to ensure that both the users and casinos could ensure that bets were placed and processed and that this was done in a fair manner. Using a smart contract hosted on a blockchain was the best way to do this. It involved creating a smart contract to do the actual betting on, requiring on chainlinks oracle to generate random numbers. The smart contract was released on a test chain because of a lack of funding but will function the exact same on a commercially used blockchain. There was a website created to interact with the smart contract and this was done in conjunction with meta mask, since this is what most users who interact with Ethereum use. The smart contract was also tested using ganache, a local chain, once again because of a lack of funding. It was published locally. Overall the smart contract worked precisely as intended. The uploaded code is missing some vital confidential parts such as API keys and some modules that need to be installed. Details can be found in the Final Dissertation PDF under Design & Development.
